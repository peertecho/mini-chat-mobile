# Mini Chat Mobile

## Usage
Start the first writer to create a room, and get the invite

```shell
npm i
npm run dev:ios  
# or npm run dev:android
```

To start the second writer, clone this project into a separate dir, then join room with the invite

```shell
npm i
npm run dev:ios
# or npm run dev:android
```

Then send one or multiple messages from both apps, after a while, they will both see all messages of each other

P.S. In this a sample app, messages are unsorted yet
